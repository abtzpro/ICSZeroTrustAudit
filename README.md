# ICSZeroTrustAudit
ICSZeroTrustAudit: a python ICS security audit based on zero trust principles

You will need to modify the hardcoded values within the code and include certain aspects to suit your use case.

The script makes use of a multitude of requests to test ICS standards, compliance checks, etc. This script automates at least 75 percent of an ICS security audit based on zero trust principles. 

The script uses openvas vulnerability scanner, snort, and more.

The included config.ini file has been boilerplate designed to be quickly edited to include the required credentials and information to smoothly run the script.

End Goal: an open source, publicly available, automated ICS Security Audit script to ease the workload of security technicians and save money where possible.
